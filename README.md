##Task
This is to showcase my , talent, education, work & programming experience.  


##Summary
As one of the best-reviewed and one of the legendary(63* years old) resturants in Chiplun(India), I knew something had to done after discovering that Shobra doesn't even have a website. This website represents information about various dishes, price list and special chef selection dishes. There are some customer reviews avaiable. It took me around 20-25 days. It is responsive which mean it is applicable to any device.

             
##Functionality added
The site was transformed from static site into fully functioning website via JAVASCRIPT, HTML5, CSS3 has a frontend and backend as Contentful. This allowed the resturant's staff to make changes to the menu item name and price list on demand through an easy-to-use interface. Other functionality included is client can contact(through contact section) owner via email.
